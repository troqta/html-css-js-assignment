                        , 1 (21 oz.) cans cherry pie filling, 1/4 cup sweetened shredded coconut, 2 tbs sliced almonds, reserved

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> Preparation: </strong>
                        Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare crust by mixing the almonds, flour, brown sugar and coconut. Cut in the shortening until
                        mixture resembles small peas. Reserve 1/2 cup of crust for topping. Press remaining crust into a
                        11 x 7 inch pan. Bake for 10 minutes or until golden brown. Prepare filling by beating all ingredients
                        together until smooth. Spread topping over partially-baked crust and bake for 15-20 minutes; remove
                        from oven and spread the cherry pie filling over the topping. Sprinkle with reserved crumbs and additional
                        coconut and almonds. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely. Refrigerate overnight.
                        Makes 12 servings.

                        <strong>Ingredients: </strong>
                        3-4 lbs chicken wings, wing tip removed and disjointed, 2-3 tbs olive oil (only use if you grill or bake the wings).
                        <strong>Sauce:</strong>
                        ¾ cup California French (Catalina) dressing - OR- regular French dressing, 3 tbs brown sugar, 2 tbs soy sauce, 2 tbs ketchup,
                        2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, ¼ tsp pepper,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> STEP 1: </strong>
                        In a small saucepan, mix all the sauce ingredients. Bring to boil over medium heat and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
                        Remove from heat and set aside.

                        <strong>STEP 2:</strong>

                        Toss the wings with the 2-3 tbs olive oil if grilling or baking
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>STEP 3:</strong>
                        Cook wings either by grilling, baking, deep frying or slow cooking. I grilled mine on my gas grill and cooked them over medium-low
                        heat for 40 minutes, turning once. Same time would apply to baking at 350 degrees F. Deep frying
                        cook at 350 degrees F for 8-9 minutes. Slow cooking 4-6 hours on low.

                        1 tbs oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 1 bag (about 4-5 cups) baby spinach or regular spinach, washed and de-stemmed, ½-1 tsp
                        coarse sea salt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> STEP 1: </strong>
                        Heat oil and crushed garlic over high heat in large saucepan. Oil must be heated almost to the smoke point. Swirl pan constantly,
                        and remove and discard garlic when it starts to turn golden.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>STEP 2:</strong>
                        Place spinach in hot oil and stir constantly, maybe for 1 minute. Add salt and stir. Spinach will wilt down to ½ the original
                        amount.

                        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. You can use either a round pizza pan or a small baking sheet (one with sides). I usually use

                        1-3-5 lb chuck roast either bone-in or boneless (about 1-inch thick), 2 cups baby carrots, 1 cup whole button mushrooms (optional),
                        3 stalks celery, cut into 3-4-inch pieces, 1 can (10.75 oz) cream of mushroom soup, low-sodium preferred,
                        4 medium potatoes, cut in half, 1 envelope dry mushroom gravy mix, 2 tbs water.

                        Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Tear off a large piece of heavy-duty aluminum foil (about 30-inches) and place it on a large
                        baking sheet (a 15- or 18-inch cookie sheet/jellyroll pan) so that equal amounts of the foil overhang
                        the sides of the baking sheet.

                        <strong>STEP 2:</strong>
                        In a small bowl, mix the soup and gravy mix; set aside.

                    <p>
                        <strong>STEP 3:</strong>
                        Place the chuck roast in the center of the foil on prepared baking sheet. Spread soup mixture over the top of the roast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>STEP 4:</strong>
                        Place the celery, potatoes, carrots and mushrooms (if using) on top of the roast. Sprinkle with the water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>STEP 5:</strong>
                        Make foil pouch by bringing up the overhanging sides and sealing top and sides well. I always leave about an inch or two
                        "cushion" on the top for steam expansion.

                        minutes. Remove foil cover during last 30 minutes of baking time.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Ingredients: </strong>
                        2-3 lb chuck roast, 1 cup rich beef stock, 1 envelope au jus gravy mix, small bay leaf, 1 bag (16 oz or so) frozen stew vegetables),
                        <strong>To Thicken (if desired):</strong>
                        ½ cup water, 2 tbs flour or cornstarch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> STEP 1: </strong>
                        Trim as much excess fat off meat. Place in the Instant Pot.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>STEP 2:</strong>
                        Mix the stock and the au jus mix in a small bowl; pour over the meat. Add the bay leaf.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>STEP 3:</strong>
                        Seal pot and set on Meat for 55 minutes (this will be 10-15 psi or HI on other pots).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>STEP 4:</strong>
                        Let pressure reduce naturally for 10 minutes, then release the pressure completely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>STEP 5:</strong>
                        You can remove the meat and keep it warm at this point--I do not.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>STEP 6:</strong>
                        Add the bag of vegetables and set the machine for low pressure for 5 minutes (or Vegetable setting on some machines)

                        Parmesan or Romano cheese, ½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese.

                        Place chicken in a baking dish or oven-proof skillet big enough to hold all the chicken pieces. I used a 10-inch cast iron
                        pan.

                        Spoon about 2 tbs of the dressing mixture on top of each chicken piece. Sprinkle the grated cheese evenly over all pieces.
                        Then sprinkle the shredded cheese evenly over the pieces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>STEP 5:</strong>
                        Bake for 20 minutes, or until chicken is 160℉ in the center of each pieces.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>STEP 6:</strong>
                        Set broiler to high and broil until the top is golden brown and bubbly.
